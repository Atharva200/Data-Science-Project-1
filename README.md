# Data-Science-Project-1

Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people whohave money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in
people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.
This project aims to create a model that will help predict this. I have tried to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.


Data: publicly available data from LendingClub.com.
Lending data from 2007-2010, we are trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. The csv used has been cleaned of NA values.


Algorithm & model used :  Decision Tree Algorithm and the Random Forest Model.

Future scope : The feature of taking stats from user and predicting based on the respective attributes can be added as a potential scope in future prespective
